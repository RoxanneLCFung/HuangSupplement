# An Orthographic Appendix

The notion that pre-modern Chinese primarily used **traditional** ideographs has no factual basis.

Many of the so-called **simplified** ideographs are in fact traditional forms. They were **stylistic variants** used in informal **registers**. Not infrequently, the simplified variant was the only attested form of an ideograph in the informal genres.

Fast forward to present-day Mandarin, it has proven futile to imagine that a single **character set** could prevail in any given population. Even within established 'simplified' regions, 'traditional' character sets are freely used in everyday communications as an aesthetic or political choice. With the arrival of personal computing, the ability to **decode** is all it requires to be able to **encode** with ease.

Today, the task of the lexicographer is simply to document which style each variant of an ideograph came from.
