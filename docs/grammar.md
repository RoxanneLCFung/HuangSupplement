## 2 Syntax

### Gaps in terminology

|          |        | [Oxford](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/tally/#the-oxford-chinese-dictionary) | Huang–Shi |

### Emic

The consequences of a failure to distinguish between **morphs** and **morphemes** are of two kinds:

1. By using the term _morpheme_ when they really mean a _morph_, one can like Huang–Shi miss a whole phenomenon like [**orthographic alternation**](#orthographic-alternation).
2. By not grasping the difference between **abstract units** and their physical **realisation**, one can fall prey to irrelevant concepts such as _êrh tzŭ tz'ŭ_ (e.g. Shên 2019) and _spondee_ which describe **orthography** and **prosody** respectively.

## 19 Lexical word-formation

### Orthographic alternation

A **lexeme** is often realised by multiple **orthographic variants**, which can be either **stylistic** variants or **free** variants. The **alternation** takes the form of **allomorphy** in one or more of the **morphs**.

**Example:** 通假 (s.xii) _vs_ 通叚 (s.xix)

## 20 Punctuation

By abandoning any pretence of being **descriptive** of real-world usage, the appendix on punctuation is probably the weakest chapter in Huang–Shi.

An adequate treatment of Mandarin punctuation must take account of the following facts:

1. Punctuation marks are _not_ an integral part of written Mandarin. It is very common in written communications to use **space** as the only punctuation **indicator**.
2. The actual **set** of punctuation marks being used varies considerably depending on the particular Mandarin-speaking **region** and personal preferences as influenced by **contact with other languages**, especially Japanese and English.
3. **Unicode** glyphs and descriptions must be used if punctuation marks are to specified unambigously.
