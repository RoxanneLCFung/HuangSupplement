### Punctuation

By abandoning any pretence of being **descriptive** of real-world usage, the appendix on punctuation is probably the weakest chapter in Huang–Shi.

An adequate treatment of Mandarin punctuation must take account of the following facts:

1. Punctuation marks are _not_ an integral part of written Mandarin. It is very common in written communications to use **space** as the only punctuation **indicator**.
2. The actual **set** of punctuation marks being used varies considerably depending on the particular Mandarin-speaking **region** and personal preferences as influenced by **contact with other languages**, especially Japanese and English.
3. **Unicode** glyphs and descriptions must be used if punctuation marks are to specified unambigously.
