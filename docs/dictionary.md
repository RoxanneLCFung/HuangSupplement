## comma, _Oxford_

Using the **Oxford comma** when there is no ambiguity conveys the **implicature** that the writer fears criticism for failing to use it.

## discourse

As a **modifier**, often pleonastic.

**Example:** discourse style.

## historical dictionary
… _vs_ **historical lexicon**

Thanks to a prolific series originally published by Scarecrow Press, **historical dictionary** no longer refers to a dictionary compiled 'on historical principles' in general usage.

**Example:** _Greek Philosophical Terms: A_ Historical Lexicon

## historical lexicology

As a discipline, **historical lexicology** has Soviet origins.

## historical principles, _on_

Not Murray's first choice.

- Skeat (1882): _An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language._

… the wording 'arranged on an historical basis' continued to be used at least as late as 1925 (Gilliver spotted it in an advertisement in the <em>Spectator</em> 17 Oct 1925, p. 678).

## hsün ku

K'ung Ying-ta of T'ang misunderstood the term **ku hsün** and the error persisted in most publications from the last century. Huang (1993), a paragon of independent thinking, corrects him. But Ch'i got it right as early as the 1940s.

## inefficiency, _stylistic_

An **inefficient** prose style can remain **functional** because it serves extralinguistic aims.

**Example:** The inexplicit prose style of **research articles** weeds out doctoral candidates who won't conform.

## phonetic loan
… _vs_ **phonemic loan**

The term **phonemic loan** originated as a mistranslation from Mandarin in the writings of scholars who don't understand English. Loanwords are never created on a phonemic basis.

## punctuation

Punctuation **indicators** are first-class **lexemes** and should be subjected to the same analysis in a dictionary as other lemmata.

## semantic inversion

A [little studied](https://traugottpeople.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj28616/files/media/file/traugott2017a.pdf) type of semantic change whereby a term ends up meaning the opposite of what it was coined to describe.

Source: [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html#:~:text=Semantic%20Inversion)

**Example:** The core meaning of `induce` being that of 'cause', `deduce` has become the verb for `induction` in the sense of 'inference', in a sort of **suppletion**.

<details>
    <summary>Those that live in fear of Garner …</summary>
… can nevertheless still write things like 'whereas in principle historical dictionaries proceed by <em>induction</em> from quotations to definition, this is impracticable in the case of terminology: the changing senses of geek can be <em>induced</em> from quotation evidence'.
</details>

## style, _manuals of_

The idea of [codifying best practice](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed18/frontmatter/acknow.html#:~:text=codify%20the%20best%20practices) is an oxymoron.

The best **typographers** pick and choose from the best the history of printing has to offer, whereas a **manual of style** merely codifies what the publisher does in-house.

**Example:** Using close-set em dash in place of en dash conveys the **implicature** that one hasn't studied any early books.

## technical terms
… on historical principles

Because the meaning of a technical term is by necessity **prescriptive** and can't be deduced from context, the correct way to write a dictionary of **technical terms** 'on historical principles' is to write the history of how each term was defined in **specialist dictionaries** and scholarship.

**Examples:** R.&#8202;L. Trask, _A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics_ (London, 1993), superseded by OED3; Katie Wales, _A Dictionary of Stylistics_ (3rd edn, London, 2011).

## theory
… in historical dictionaries

Trying to keep **theory** out of a dictionary is fighting a losing battle. The very act of definition writing is already theorising.

**Example:** OED3 keeps relying on the theory of **ablaut** and reconstructed **PIE semantics** in spite of having deleted all the PIE forms from its site.
