## historical dictionary
… _vs_ **historical lexicon**

Thanks to a prolific series originally published by Scarecrow Press, **historical dictionary** no longer refers to a dictionary compiled 'on historical principles' in general usage.

**Example:** _Greek Philosophical Terms: A_ Historical Lexicon

## phonetic loan
… _vs_ **phonemic loan**

The term **phonemic loan** originated as a mistranslation in the writings of scholars who don't understand English. Loanwords are never created on a phonemic basis.

## technical terms
… on historical principles

Because the meaning of a technical term is usually prescriptive and can't be deduced from context, the correct way to write a dictionary of **technical terms** 'on historical principles' is to write a history of how specialist dictionaries define the terms.
