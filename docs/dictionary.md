## historical dictionary
… _vs_ **historical lexicon**

Thanks to a prolific series originally published by Scarecrow Press, **historical dictionary** no longer refers to a dictionary compiled 'on historical principles' in general usage.

**Example:** _Greek Philosophical Terms: A_ Historical Lexicon

## historical lexicology

As a discipline, **historical lexicology** has Soviet origins.

## historical principles, _on_

Not Murray's first choice.

- Skeat (1882): _An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language._

… the wording 'arranged on an historical basis' continued to be used at least as late as 1925 (Gilliver spotted it in an advertisement in the Spectator 17 Oct 1925, p. 678).

## hsün ku

K'ung Ying-ta of T'ang misunderstood the term **ku hsün** and the error persisted in most publications from the last century. Huang (1993), a paragon of independent thinking, corrects him. But Ch'i got it right as early as the 1940s.

## phonetic loan
… _vs_ **phonemic loan**

The term **phonemic loan** originated as a mistranslation from Mandarin in the writings of scholars who don't understand English. Loanwords are never created on a phonemic basis.

## semantic inversion

A [little studied](https://traugottpeople.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj28616/files/media/file/traugott2017a.pdf) type of semantic change whereby a term ends up meaning the opposite of what it was coined to describe.

Source: [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html#:~:text=Semantic%20Inversion)

**Example:** The core meaning of `induce` being that of 'cause', `deduce` has become the verb for `induction` in the sense of 'inference', in a sort of **suppletion**.

<details>
    <summary>Those that live in fear of Garner …</summary>
… can nevertheless still write things like 'whereas in principle historical dictionaries proceed by <em>induction</em> from quotations to definition, this is impracticable in the case of terminology: the changing senses of geek can be <em>induced</em> from quotation evidence'.
</details>

## technical terms
… on historical principles

Because the meaning of a technical term is by necessity **prescriptive** and can't be deduced from context, the correct way to write a dictionary of **technical terms** 'on historical principles' is to write the history of how each term was defined in **specialist dictionaries** and scholarship.

**Example:** R.&#8202;L. Trask, _A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics_ (London, 1993), superseded by OED3.

## theory
… in historical dictionaries

Trying to keep **theory** out of a dictionary is fighting a losing battle. The very act of definition writing is already theorising.

**Example:** OED3 keeps relying on the theory of **ablaut** and reconstructed **PIE semantics** in spite of having deleted all the PIE forms from its site.
