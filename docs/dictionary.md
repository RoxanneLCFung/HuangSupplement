# Critical Dictionary of Lexicography and Linguistics
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Chinese, _Ancient_

Bernhard Karlgren's term for the language around 600AD as codified in the dictionary Ch’ieh yün. A snapshot, not a period.

## Chinese, _Archaic_

Bernhard Karlgren's term for the language of the Hênan region during the first Chou centuries (from 1028BC).

## comma, _Oxford_

Using the **Oxford comma** when there is no ambiguity conveys the **implicature** that the writer fears criticism for failing to use it.

## dictionary of record

A term coined by John Simpson in 2001 which has delayed the completion of OED3 for twenty years.

See also [**OED3**](#oed3).

## discourse

As a **modifier**, often pleonastic.

**Example:** _the compact, inexplicit_ discourse _style of research articles_ (2016)

## evidence, _dictionary_

The process of compiling a dictionary isn't fundamentally different from writing other kinds of books. The lexicographer selects words he thinks exist in the language as lemmas and uses words he knows (or invents) to explain them. And just like in other types of writings, dictionaries may contain erroneous or **nonce words**.

    <p>Sometimes, however, <strong>dictionary evidence</strong> requires careful handling:</p>

      <li>For words that are found exclusively in dictionaries, see Peter Gilliver, 'Dictionary words', in John Considine (ed.), <em>Adventuring in Dictionaries: New Studies in the History of Lexicography</em> (Newcastle upon Tyne, 2010), 216–8.</li>
      <li>Evidence from dictionaries compiled by foreigners for a foreign readership may not reflect the usage of native speakers. For an earlier attempt to control such evidence with quotations from other sources (and the difficulties involved), see the specimens in Shen Kuo-wei, '『中日近代新詞詞源詞典』の編纂について',『或問』, 28 (2015), 228–42.</li>
    </ol>

## 'Great' Vowel-shift, _the_

Jespersen's term for a now-superseded description of the changes undergone by long vowels in the history of **Standard English**.

## historical dictionary
… _vs_ **historical lexicon**

Thanks to a prolific series originally published by Scarecrow Press, **historical dictionary** no longer refers to a dictionary compiled 'on historical principles' in general usage.

**Example:** _Greek Philosophical Terms: A_ Historical Lexicon

See also [**lexicon**](#lexicon).

## historical lexicology

As a discipline, **historical lexicology** has Soviet origins.

## historical principles, _on_

Not Murray's first choice.

## hsün ku

K'ung Ying-ta of T'ang misunderstood the term **ku hsün** and the error persisted in most publications from the last century. Huang (1993), a paragon of independent thinking, corrects him. But Ch'i got it right as early as the 1940s.

## ideograph
… _vs_ **logograph**

When applied to the **Chinese** language, **logograph** describes only a subset of ideographs – unless _logo-_ is coerced into covering **bound morphemes**, at which point the term becomes redundant.

## inefficiency, _stylistic_

An **inefficient** prose style can remain **functional** because it serves extralinguistic aims.

**Example:** The inexplicit prose style of **research articles** weeds out doctoral candidates who won't conform.

## kerning

Bad **kerning** in a typeset document conveys the **implicature** that the type was set by a typist, not a typographer. Now largely taken care of by [browsers](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#font-kerning-prop) if a well-made **kerning table** is included with the font.

**Examples:** _The Chicago Manual of Style_ (17th edn), typeset by Graphic Composition, Inc., relied on a faulty kerning table; _New Hart’s Rules_ (2nd edn), typeset in-house at OUP, used unkerned numerals.

## lexicon

The curiously precise 'chiefly applied to a dictionary of Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, or Arabic' in OED1, copied by Fowler and now ODE, was an accident of history.

Bartholomew Price had actually proposed 'The Oxford Latin Lexicon' for the Clarendon edition of _Harper’s Latin Dictionary_ in 1878.

(props C. Stray)

## OED3

With so many entries remaining unrevised after a quarter of a century's work, OED3 should stop competing with dictionaries of **current English** such as ODE and focus on revising existing entries as a **period dictionary**.

New words and new senses can be more easily added in OED4 drawing on the material accumulated in successive editions of the **corpus-based** ODE.

The ideal roadmap for the OED is thus OED2 (updating) > OED3 (revision) > OED4 (updating) > OED5 (revision) and so forth.

## Onions, _C.&#8202;T._

ˈʌn.jənz

## peer review, _unsigned_

A genre of scholarly **peer review** which takes the form of a private **letter** addressed to the editor of a learned journal; the opposite of **open peer review**.

Reasons for using the genre include:

1. disciplinary tradition;
2. language that deviates from the norms of collegial behaviour;
3. scholarly opinions the writer fears to be associated with publicly.

    </ul>
</details>

## periodisation, _linguistic_

One or more **political periods** rounded off to the nearest century to hide the fact that they are political periods.

## phonetic loan
… _vs_ **phonemic loan**

The term **phonemic loan** originated as a mistranslation from Mandarin in the writings of scholars who don't understand English. Loanwords are never created on a phonemic basis.

## pieh tzu

An older term for the orthographic variant of an **ideograph**. See HuangSupplement s.v. [別字(1)](https://t18d.github.io/HuangSupplement/#:~:text=%E5%88%A5%E5%AD%97(1)).

## punctuation

Punctuation **indicators** are first-class **lexemes** and should be subjected to the same analysis in a dictionary as other lemmata.

## semantic inversion

A [little studied](https://traugottpeople.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj28616/files/media/file/traugott2017a.pdf) type of semantic change whereby a term ends up meaning the opposite of what it was coined to describe.

Source: [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html#:~:text=Semantic%20Inversion)

**Example:** The core meaning of `induce` being that of 'cause', `deduce` has become the verb for `induction` in the sense of 'inference', in a sort of **suppletion**.

<details>
    <summary>Those that live in fear of Garner …</summary>
… can nevertheless still write things like 'whereas in principle historical dictionaries proceed by <em>induction</em> from quotations to definition, this is impracticable in the case of terminology: the changing senses of geek can be <em>induced</em> from quotation evidence'.
</details>

## sets, _consistency of_

The principle that all the terms in a set should be defined in a dictionary regardless of **frequency** and consistently.

## style, _manuals of_

The idea of [codifying best practice](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed18/frontmatter/acknow.html#:~:text=codify%20the%20best%20practices) is an oxymoron.

The best **typographers** pick and choose from the best the history of printing has to offer, whereas a **manual of style** merely codifies what the publisher does in-house.

**Example:** Using close-set em dash in place of en dash conveys the **implicature** that one hasn't studied any early books.

    </ul>
</details>

## technical terms
… on historical principles

Because the meaning of a technical term is by necessity **prescriptive** and can't be deduced from context, the correct way to write a dictionary of **technical terms** 'on historical principles' is to write the history of how each term was defined in **specialist dictionaries** and scholarship.

**Examples:** R.&#8202;L. Trask, _A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics_ (London, 1993), superseded by OED3; Katie Wales, _A Dictionary of Stylistics_ (3rd edn, London, 2011).

## theory
… in historical dictionaries

Trying to keep **theory** out of a dictionary is fighting a losing battle. The very act of definition writing is already theorising.

**Example:** OED3 keeps relying on the theory of **ablaut** and reconstructed **PIE semantics** in spite of having deleted all the PIE forms from its site.

## topolect

A **calque** coined by Victor Mair to render the pre-modern _fang yen_ into English.

## _Tz'u-yüan_

Originally the title of a [**historical dictionary**](#historical-dictionary) (cf. '然辭有引伸假借有沿革變遷舉甲不能遺乙有委不能無源'); in vulgar usage, a fancy way of saying _tz'u yüan_ ('etymology').
