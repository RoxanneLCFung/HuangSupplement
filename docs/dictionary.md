## historical dictionary
… _vs_ **historical lexicon**

Thanks to a prolific series originally published by Scarecrow Press, **historical dictionary** no longer refers to a dictionary compiled 'on historical principles' in general usage.

**Example:** _Greek Philosophical Terms: A_ Historical Lexicon

## historical lexicology

As a discipline, **historical lexicology** has Soviet origins.

## hsün ku

K'ung Ying-ta of T'ang misunderstood the term **ku hsün** and the error persisted in most publications from the last century. Huang (1993), a paragon of independent thinking, corrects him. But Ch'i got it right as early as the 1940s.

## phonetic loan
… _vs_ **phonemic loan**

The term **phonemic loan** originated as a mistranslation in the writings of scholars who don't understand English. Loanwords are never created on a phonemic basis.

## semantic inversion

A [little studied](https://traugottpeople.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj28616/files/media/file/traugott2017a.pdf) type of semantic change whereby a term ends up meaning the opposite of what it was coined to describe.

Source: [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html#:~:text=Semantic%20Inversion)

**Example:** The core meaning of `induce` being that of 'cause', `deduce` has become the verb for `induction` in the sense of 'inference', in a sort of **suppletion**.

<details>
    <summary>Those that live in fear of Garner …</summary>
… can nevertheless still write things like 'whereas in principle historical dictionaries proceed by <em>induction</em> from quotations to definition, this is impracticable in the case of terminology: the changing senses of geek can be <em>induced</em> from quotation evidence'.
</details>

## technical terms
… on historical principles

Because the meaning of a technical term is by necessity prescriptive and can't be deduced from context, the correct way to write a dictionary of **technical terms** 'on historical principles' is to write the history of how specialist dictionaries defined each term.
