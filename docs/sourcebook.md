## Highlights from _The Making of the Oxford English Dictionary_

### the 'Craigie–Wyllie policy'
> For **Craigie** ‘[t]he great question [was] how to make the best of the situation’;
and this could be done by taking whatever material there was and working it up into
as complete a form as possible, making notes on what additional information or
evidence was required which could be dealt with in due course. He favoured the idea
that several assistants could each be assigned a letter or letters on this basis, as a means
of making quick inroads on the whole alphabet, and bringing significant gaps to light
which could then be addressed.

> **Onions**’s approach, by contrast, was to work steadily
through the material, making it as complete as possible – conducting research in the
Bodleian Library and elsewhere if necessary – before moving on.

> **Sisam**, who after all
had some experience of the work, had long ago spotted a disadvantage of this method,
namely the temptation for assistants to spend more and more time on research, which
they found more appealing than the ‘hard and steady work’ of preparing copy in the
Old Ashmolean.… Sisam had recently drawn
attention to the effect on progress of Mrs Powell’s ‘drifting more & more into the Bodleian’.
