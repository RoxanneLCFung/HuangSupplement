## IC analysis

> 忠厚老成者擯之為無能，俠少儇辨者取之為可用，守道愛國者謂之為流俗，敗常害民者謂之為通變。

I do not think 愛國者 here is a constituent. I'm leaning towards `[[守道][愛國]者]謂之為流俗` where 者 is not attached to 愛國 as a suffix.

## new edition, new name

Schmidt mistakenly dated _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese_ to 1913, when it was first published in 1917 (see [preface](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021731313&seq=9) in the book dated 1917, where Mateer stated that the 1917 _Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese_ was an improvement to the _New Terms for New Ideas_ published in 1913.

## original punctuations

> It was a 。 in the 1934 edition of [飲冰室全集](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SSID-13347803_%E9%A3%B2%E5%86%B0%E5%AE%A4%E5%85%A8%E9%9B%86_%E4%B8%8A.pdf). 自由書 was originally written in 1899.

This is actually non-trivial: even when an author personally oversaw the production of their own collected edition, there’s no guarantee that what they print there reflects what they printed the first time.

What gets changed may be a punctuation mark, but it could just as likely be a word.

## searching OCR layer

> 安樂椅子 not found in New Terms for New Ideas (1913) or Hand Book of New Terms and Newspaper Chinese (1917)

Characters can easily get dropped so you just have to search for all the substrings as well before you can say for sure that it’s not there.

That’s the lexicology counterpart to the phonetician Chao’s 言無難.
